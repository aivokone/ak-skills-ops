## Contributing / Adding Skills

This repo follows a progressive disclosure pattern: keep `SKILL.md` lean and
put detailed procedures under `references/`.

Policy: do not add `skills/<skill-name>/README.md`; keep agent-essential
behavior in `SKILL.md` and keep human-readable catalog details in root
`README.md`.

When adding a new skill or making a major update to an existing skill, update:
- `README.md` (both `Skills Index` and `Skill Catalog` section for that skill)
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (plugin manifest)

Contributor conventions live in `AGENTS.md`.
